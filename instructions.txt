# Possibilities
	- The buttons might not work, in that case, try double clicking or having a slight delay between the clicks

# How to run ---
    if you have python (needs to be added to path and has to include Tcl/Tkinter module), go to the 
    source folder and double click on the main.py (might be slow on the first time)

    - should also have pygame installed 
    - pygame can be installed via the command prompt (pip install pygame)

    but if you don't have python, go to the build folder and run the main.exe file. If it gives
    you and error, try getting Visual C++ Distributable. 

# Keep in Mind
	- No matter if it's the .exe or the .py, it will crash it it doesn't find the components folder
	(keep the components folder in the same folder as the main.py or main.exe)

# How to use

	- The creator can create quizes and save it, then the save file can be sent to the students
